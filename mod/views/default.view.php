						<strong>Seekuni needs your support to keep our data current and useful.</strong><br /><br />
						You can help by adding new courses which we don't have on record, removing incorrect or outdated information and correcting information which
						might have changed since it was written.
						<br /><br />
						Seekuni only works because we have a group of users who support the site and the data we carry.  If you are a student, remember that you are doing
						your university a service by adding information about their courses, you improve the funding they receive by making the courses they offer visible 
						to more prospective students.
						<br /><br />
						It's up to you to support seekuni.
