						The objectives of moderation are simple.<br />
						The primary aim is to keep our database as large and as accurate as we can.
						
						<br /><br />
						<strong>Add</strong> new university courses as you find them.<br />
						Even if you can only find some vague information at first, as long as you are sure it is correct, add it!<br /><br />
						
						<strong>Edit</strong> incorrect or outdated information out of the database.<br />
						Even if this means removing a course because it happens that the information is complete rubbish.<br /><br />
						
						<strong>Support</strong> the community.<br />
						Everyone needs some help once in a while, check out the forums and try to give someone a hand, they might be trying to
						choose a university, or just having difficulty using the site.

						It's up to you to support seekuni.<br />
						Moreover it's up to you to support it's users.
